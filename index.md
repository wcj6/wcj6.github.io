# About Me

<img src="wcj.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi! Here is **Chunjiang Wang (Ethan, 王春江)**.<br>

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [MIRACLE Lab](https://miracle.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my M.S. degree from the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Shanjiang Tang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=B3-5FJUAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I earned my B.E. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Tiangong University in 2019.

My research interests center around **trustworthy medical image analysis, vision-language alignment, and multi-modal fusion**. My work aims to develop reliable and robust medical AI systems by bridging the gap between visual and linguistic modalities, enhancing interpretability, and ensuring trustworthy decision-making in clinical scenarios.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at: chunjiang_wang [at] mail.ustc.edu.cn
